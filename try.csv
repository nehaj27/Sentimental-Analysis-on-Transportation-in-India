If fuel prices keep rising due to the US-Iran conflict and if the rupee depreciates further, then the economy could be in for a fix, said the Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training (IFTRT), a body that tracks truck prices.
December 2019 witnessed a Rs 2.16 a litre (ex-Delhi) increase in diesel prices, while full truck load rentals declined further by 2-2.5 per cent on trunk routes due to the general economic slowdown.
Cargo offerings in December 2019 fell by 10-15 per cent on average, on lower factory output and stalled infrastructure projects, added IFTRT.
Overall, calendar 2019 witnessed a 10.4-19.4 per cent fall in truck rentals between December 2018 and December 2019, said the research body, adding, this is despite an average 8.2 per cent increase in diesel prices during the period.",

4,07/16/2020,"States can fix minimum freight rates for trucks, says Road Ministry","Following a demand from transport associations, the Road Transport and Highways Ministry has reminded various States that it is possible for them to fix a minimum floor price for cargo movement.
Simply put, freight rate is the amount charged by truck drivers for moving goods between two different places.
States are free to fix a range of minimum and maximum rate for freight and several forms of passenger transport, the Road Transport Ministry has reiterated in a letter to States on July 10.
The Road transport Ministry issued this guidance citing representation from transport associations that asked the Ministry to fix the minimum freight rates in view of “economic turbulence, weak demand and other factors”, according to an advisory.
Even though a section of transporters had sought government intervention to fix a minimum freight rate limit, the move will create a rift in other sections of transporters, say transport experts.",

“In some routes where the demand is strong, the increase is as much as 20 per cent,” said SP Singh, senior fellow at IFTRT.
Now that demand is picking up gradually, they don’t want to be saddled with stock and are therefore not complaining of high freight rates,” said Singh, adding that the diesel price hike has come as an excuse for many to charge more.

Meanwhile, transport unions are asking the Centre and other States to take a cue from Delhi and lower diesel prices.
Long-distance trucks bypassing Delhi are unlikely to change their routes to fill their tanks in the city for two reasons.
That said, vehicle users in Delhi – commercial and private — who’d avoided filling their fuel tanks due to the higher prices will no longer do so.
Last Thursday, Delhi announced a reduction in VAT on diesel from 30 per cent to 16.75 per cent, which made diesel prices in Delhi cheaper by ₹8.36 per litre.",
